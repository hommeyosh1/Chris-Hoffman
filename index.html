                Itch.io Profile Description Hey, I’m Christopher “The Hommeyosh”
                Hoffman — an independent game developer, 3D designer, and
                animator from Pittsburgh. I build games, characters, and worlds
                using Unreal Engine, Blender, Character Creator 4, and iClone 8.
                I also design my own assets, animate custom characters, and
                create full pipelines from modeling to gameplay. I’ve released
                projects like Cyber Hockey and EDEN, and I’m always working on
                new ideas—from action shooters to horror experiences and
                creative experiments. My focus is on gameplay, strong visuals,
                and bringing characters to life. I create everything myself: •
                3D modeling & sculpting • Animation • Level design •
                Blueprint/gameplay logic • UI & visual effects • Optimization
                and polish
            </p>

        <h2>Featured Game: Circle Drop</h2>
            <div class="image-container">

                <a href="https://circledrop.replit.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="explore-btn">Explore</a>
            </div>
            <p>Circle Drop is a browser-based puzzle game I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Canvas API handling the dynamic visuals and animations. The game is inspired by Tetris but uses patterned circles instead of blocks, challenging players to match each falling circle with the correct platform. I designed the entire gameplay loop from scratch, including collision detection, increasing difficulty, and responsive controls for both desktop and mobile touchscreen play.

            I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design the game to play seamlessly on both browsers and mobile devices, ensuring smooth touch controls for an enhanced mobile experience. I handled every aspect of the project independently—from game design and programming to testing and deployment. The game is hosted on Replit, allowing for easy access and sharing. This project demonstrates my ability to bring a full concept to life using web technologies and showcases my skills in logic design, user interaction, and browser-based game development.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">Eden is an open-world game made in Unreal Engine 5. I created the characters and animations using CC4 and iClone. The game features exploration, quests, and real-time combat, highlighting my skills in 3D art, animation, and gameplay design.</p>

        <p>The game at mazeman.replit.app is a browser-based Pac-Man clone built with JavaScript. It features classic maze navigation, point collection, and enemy avoidance. The game works on PC, tablet, and phone, though mobile compatibility still needs some adjustments. Currently, there are two levels available. This project showcases my skills in web-based game development and programming.</p>

        <h2>Open World FPS TechDemo in Unity: A First-Person Shooter Experience</h2>
        <a href="https://play.unity.com/en/games/bf6df921-6b86-41da-b179-aeb0579d43f1/fpsowdemo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

        </a>
        <p>I created a Unity tech demo featuring an open world with green grass and animated trees. The demo utilizes Unity’s terrain feature, where I painted textures to give the environment a natural look. It includes a first-person character equipped with an animated gun, which fires a shot with a sound effect when the right mouse button is pressed. The player can move using the WASD keys, aim with the mouse, jump, and the crosshairs are implemented using Unity's UI system. Additionally, I added background sound using an MP3 file to enhance the atmosphere. This project demonstrates my skills in Unity, animation, sound integration, and first-person controls, all programmed in C# using Visual Studio Code (VSC).</p>
